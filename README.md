# Balloon Popper ðŸ§©

![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)

Balloons start free falling from the top of the screen in all directions. The player must tap the balloons falling from the top of the screen before they hit the floor. The balloons will automatically disappear once they reach the bottom of the screen, so the player will no longer be able to use the fallen balloons as point-makers. The speed at which the balloons fall from the top of the screen will be time-sensitive. The longer the player stays at the game, the faster the balloons will be dropping from the top of the screen. After a set amount of balloons have hit the ground, it's Game Over for the player. 

Balloon Popper is built with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
